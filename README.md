# expense-tracker

This web application allows users to manage their expenses. Specifically, they can view all the expenses they have entered, create a new expense, update an existing one, or delete it. To perform these actions, users must first register on the application and then log in with their credentials (email and password). The security of the application is ensured using JWT tokens and the HS256 encryption algorithm. There is also an admin role, which can view all active users of the system and delete any of them. The admin logs in with their own credentials (email and password). Upon the first launch of the application, the @Bean CommandLineRunner in the ExpenseTrackerApplication class initializes the appropriate entries in the database (such as user groups, permissions, admin, modules, and module actions). Users and admins have different permissions and can perform different functions, ensuring the smooth and secure operation of the application.
